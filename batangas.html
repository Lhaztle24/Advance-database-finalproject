            <li> This lake is the deepest in the Philippines. </li>
            <li> Basilica of St. Martin de Tours
- Stepping into this church is like visiting one of the old renaissance churches in Europe. It is huge, beautifully decorated, has an imposing façade, etc. While an old church where it now stands was built when the town was founded in the 1570s, </li>
            <li> Aquaria Water Park
- Welcome to the tropical wonderland nestled along Calatagan South Beach (CaSoBe), where 525-meters of fine white sand await you. Turn your vacation into a splashin’ good time and have awesome fun </li>
